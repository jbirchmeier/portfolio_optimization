Steps I took to optimize page speed: 

- minify all CSS
- minify all JS
These two steps brought me up to between a 60-70 page score

- move JS script to bottom of html
- minimize images with grunt imagemin
- optimize images with ImageOptim
Once I optimized my images my score increased to low 80â€™s


- inline all css/js with grunt
So close! 91 on mobile but only 88 on desktop

- compress files with grunt

for pizza.html: 
- adjusted two for loops to lower total pizza images on the page and speed up loading and scrolling; see comments in main.js
